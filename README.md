A Psychological Mind Hacking Programme!
<br>
Info:- When a victim clicks on the project's deployment link you send them, they'll see all their device and network info - this will often make the victim think you have all their information so you can track them. Through such psychological mind hacking you can try to get into the victim's mind!

Thank You.
